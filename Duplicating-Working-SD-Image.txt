BBB New Duplicating Image

# 3-25-2020 Ken. Thank you zmatt.

# For example, if the source is /dev/mmcblk0 and destination is /dev/sda
# Source being SD-Card in BBB and destination being hung off USB port

# ===> Boot off eMMc <===
 
# Shrink the source:

# First become superuser

sudo -s

e2fsck -f /dev/mmcblk0p1

resize2fs -M /dev/mmcblk0p1

# ^^^ It will tell you how big the filesystem now is in 4K blocks. 
# Divide by 1024 and round up to get the size of the filesystem in 4M blocks.
 
echo 'start=8192,bootable' | sfdisk /dev/sda
 
# Copy the filesystem to the destination. 
# Fill in the correct number of 4M blocks for COUNT from above

dd if=/dev/mmcblk0p1 of=/dev/sda1 bs=4M count=.... conv=fdatasync
 
# Expand filesystem on destination

resize2fs /dev/sda1
 
# Copy bootloader

dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/sda skip=1 seek=1 count=8191 conv=fdatasync
 
# If you want to continue using the old filesystem, Expand it again

resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p1

# ===> Remove externally mounted SD-Card on USB adapter

# Give the new filesystem a new unique identifier if needed

yes | tune2fs -U random /dev/sda1

# If you want to reboot off internal SD-Card use command

reboot

# All done
