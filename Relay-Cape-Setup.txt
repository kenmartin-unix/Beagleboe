Initialize (relays to out) after an install

echo 20  > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio20/direction
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio7/direction
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio112/direction
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio115/direction


BBGW Note

Well I set the default directory to 
/sys/class/gpio
and issued the command
echo 112 > export
and like magic the gpio112 appeared. It works now. Don't know why gpio112 was not automatically created however.
